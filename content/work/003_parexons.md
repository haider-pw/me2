position: Senior PHP Developer
description: I joined this company as a Senior PHP Developer, and with time I got to the position of Team
  Lead, where I have worked on a variety of projects from small websites to big products, some of them I
  have mentioned below. Most projects/Products i have worked under this company were developed
  under the Codeigniter framework with mysql database on backend. But i was not only limited to these
  3 frameworks and worked on wordpress, even worked once on a small issue of C# .NET, so it was
  challenging working in an environment where I had to deal with project varieties. <br />
  Another role as a team lead I had to work with the internees and other junior developers, had to lead
  them and utilize their efficiency in a manner that they could be productive for the company, by dividing
  the existing project workload and assigning tasks to team members depending on their capabilities.
